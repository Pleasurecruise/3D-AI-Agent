# 3D-AI-Agent
## Overview

This project aims to create an AI agent capable of expressing a range of emotions through facial expressions and tone of voice, using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision Models (LVMs). 

The agent will feature a 3D face model for realistic visualization, enhancing emotional authenticity and interaction. By tackling the challenges of real-time emotion synthesis, this project offers students hands-on experience with advanced AI, visual modelling, and natural language processing to build a more life-like and empathetic AI interaction.

Tasks to be done:

- Develop an avatar with the ability to display a range of facial expressions using Unity3D.
- Integrate LLMs (such as Chat GPT) into the avatar to enable voice interaction accompanied by corresponding facial expressions.
- Upon successful completion of the above, implement additional hand gestures to “upgrade” the avatar.
